        Hi there!üëãüèº I&apos;m Imam Hari Maulana, I&apos;m currently living in
        Bekasi, Indonesia. I am a software engineer with a solid foundation in
        problem-solving, attention to detail, and a high commitment to
        delivering quality solutions. My background as a machine operator has
        equipped me with a unique perspective on workflow optimization and the
        ability to perform under pressure‚Äîskills I now apply to software
        development. After completing intensive training at RevoU, I gained
        expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, React JS, Next JS, Python, Flask,
        and MySQL, enabling a smooth transition into software engineering. With
        a combination of technical expertise, analytical thinking, and strong
        collaboration skills, I am ready to tackle challenges in any software
        project. My dedication to user-centered design and process optimization
        drives my desire to contribute meaningfully to innovative and
        technology-driven companies.
